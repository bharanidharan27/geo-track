# geo-track
GeoTrack is a geo-distributed parcel tracking and estimated-time-of-arrival (ETA) platform designed to simulate real-world logistics data across multiple regions. It showcases partitioning, replication, fault tolerance, and observability in a distributed database system using CockroachDB and Kafka as core components.

# Overview
GeoTrack models a multi-region parcel logistics network, demonstrating how distributed systems handle massive event streams, regional data locality, and real-time updates.
It includes synthetic data generation of millions of parcel events, Kafka-based ingestion, CockroachDB geo-partitioned storage, and metrics visualization with Prometheus & Grafana.
